<h3 align="center">🔢 Welcome to my Introductory MATLAB Course 🔢</h3>

- ➡️ In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of MATLAB from defining variables to loops, functions, and 3D visualization
- ➡️ You will also have the opportunity of testing yourself with the problems having different difficulty levels

<h3 align="center">🧠 Brainstorming 🤯</h3>

- ➡️ If you would like to test your MATLAB and algorithm skills with challenging problems, [brainstorming session](https://github.com/burakozpoyraz/MATLAB-101/tree/main/Brainstorming) is your cup of tea 😎
- ➡️ Each problem in the brainstorming session consists of two parts:

❓ ***1P1B: 1 PROBLEM 1 BİLGİ KÖŞESİ*** 💡

- ➡️ This part provides a built-in MATLAB function and its example usage. It might be the well-known usage of the function or a particular use case. Thus, you will learn prior to challenging yourself!

💢 ***PROBLEM*** ♨️

- ➡️ This part informs you about the topic of the problem, lists MATLAB structures you have to know (vectors, loops, etc.), and explains the problem. Your mission is to create the function with the given name, and ensure it works as expected. Once your function is ready, you can run the test cases and check if you pass these test cases. Good luck!
